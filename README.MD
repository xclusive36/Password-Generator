# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

This project is all about working with JavaScript by developing a simple password generator. We were provided with a html and css template, and we were tasked with generating the JavaScript variables and function to complete the task.

The web appplication generates a random password by asking the user to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Once a password length has been set, the application asks the user more questions about what to include in the generated password. Should the generator include Lower case, Upper case characters? Should it include Numbers or Special characters?

The Javascript converts the password length to a number, checks if the number is within 8 - 128 characters
